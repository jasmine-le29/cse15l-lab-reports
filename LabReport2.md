# Part 3
- I learned from week 2/3 how to use the ssh command to connect to a remote server. We could access our personalized usernames and change our passwords to access our remote server. Upon completing this lab report, instead of having to enter our password every time we would log in to our remote server, we could set up and save the public key and save our password.
