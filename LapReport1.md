- The argument for cd with no arguments remained the same and nothing happened. When cd was called with a path to the cd directory, it moved to lecture1 and now the argument is in "lecture1". Since cd is already in the directory path, we can call a file within lecture1, for example, when we call "README", it displays "Not a directory". This gives an error because README is a file and not a directory.

# ls

- The argument for ls with no arguments displays "lecture1" which is the main folder containing all the files and other folders within. When we ls "lecture1", it displays all the the files contained in lecture1.
